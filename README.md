# ANUVAAD
## An app to translate text obtained from given input image in a particular desired language using image processing and deep learning.

*************************************
### *Description*: 

*Image are uploaded with the help of Android application onto server will the process the image. Firstly image will undergo various edits such as Binarization, Median Blurring, Adaptive Threshold, etc. then the text form the image is extracted using tesseract library. The extracted text is then provided to the GoogleTrans to convert the obtained text into user desired language.*

```
1.Image processing-Scaling,Convert to gray,Binarization,Bilateral Filtering,Adaptive Thresholding.
2.The primary character classifier function in Tesseract OCR is based on an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory neural network or LSTM network. 
3.Training Tesseract to improve performance.
4.Googletrans for translation of the extracted text.
```
*****************************************
### *Technology stack*:

Python,HTML,CSS,Flask
Tesseract,OpenCV,Googletrans
*****************************************

### *Key functionality*: 
```
1.Preprocess the image.
2.Perform text Extraction.
3.Translate the extracted test.
4.Display of results in app.
```
**************************************

### *Running the code*:

```
1. Download the repository.
2. Activate the flask server.
3. Upload index.py file to the server.
4. Enter the language of the text in image.
5. Enter the language in which text to be translated. 
6. Select the image from the phone and get output as translated text.
```
